## Description

Webpage that simulates drawing on an Etch-a-Sketch by hovering the user's mouse over the sketchbook tiles.
The tiles will change from their original background color to a different background color displaying a path generated from the cursor's
path. Each subsequent time the cursor passes over a tile, the color will shade in a darker tone.

The user may reset the sketchbook and specify their desired size by inputting the number of tiles to form the X/Y axes.

**Note**: This project was developed for desktop/laptop functionality. Cursor/mouse drawing must be done with a computer mouse,
not on a touchscreen device. Additionally, page layout responsiveness favors computer screens over mobile devices currently.

This project was developed from guidelines found at [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch)

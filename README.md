## Description

Web site that simulates drawing on an Etch-a-Sketch by hovering the user's mouse over the sketchbook tiles.
The tiles will change from their original background color to a different background color displaying a path generated from the cursor's
path.

The user may reset the sketchbook and specify their desired size by inputting the number of tiles to form the X/Y axes.

This project was developed from guidelines found at [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch)
